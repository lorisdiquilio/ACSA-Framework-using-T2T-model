As someone who has relatively severe acne, it’s hard for me to justify continuing to buy this stuff because of how small of a bottle it is.

She said she loves how lightweight this feels on her skin, that it’s hydrating (loves products with niacinamide). She said she actually likes that this has smaller percentage of retinol since it’s summer and she spends more time outdoors and doesn’t want to irritate her skin barrier.

I absolutely LOVE this face wash. I love the smell so much that as I’m cleansing, I don’t want to rinse it!! It’s intensely lovely!!! I love how my skin feels now, and I cannot imagine anything working as well with my sensitive skin as this has in such a short time. The texture and all-over look and feel of my face has improved immensely since using this. I’ve been using it for 2 years, and never going back. A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts a long time. Results say it all, I’m hooked.

Like some other reviewers, I must have gotten a bad bottle. I’ve been using this lotion for years and have never noticed an off-putting smell like this. I opened the bottle to look at it and the consistency is also off—weird, chunky, separated.	Others#-1	Smell#-1	Texture/Thickness#-1
I know that everyone has different skin, but I thought I'd write this review just incase others have experienced the same thing. I used this product maybe 10-12 times before I realized it was drying out the delicate skin above and below my eyes and the skin around my mouth. These areas are now constantly flakey and the skin below is raw and painful to touch. I've been treating them with medicated moisturizer for about a week.  Ouch ouch ouch. Be careful with products and make sure to discontinue use as soon as you notice any problems.  Good luck!	Others#0	Skin/Hair Issue#-1	Texture/Thickness#-1	Recommendation#-1

It is a heavier cream that would be great for normal or dry skin, but for combination skin and hot weather it caused a break out.	Texture/Thickness#0	Suitability#2	Skin/Hair Issue#-1
I’m obsessed with this cleanser. I have sensitive, acne prone combo skin and this doesn’t break me out, doesn’t make me oily and doesn’t dry me out. It’s super lightweight and feels so smooth and clean. Totally worth the price especially because you only need a tiny amount each time so it lasts very long. It’s great to pair with an oil cleanser at night and also just on its own if you don’t wear makeup or sunscreen.

The most slovenly, lazy packaging of a postal item i have ever had. Disgraceful and sloppy, frankly I was insulted. The serum however is effective and easy to apply. Have to say though the shine was taken off the experience by such disregard for product safety in transit, a torn bit of crumpled polythene half the size of the serum box stuck together with a bit of scrunched up tape did not protect the product, it arrived in a box that was crumpled, and it looked as if it was twenty years old and had been to hell and back. Now to be fair I know the serum bottle is what I bought and it was in1 piece, nevertheless it is unacceptable to have such apathy towards any part of the customer process and experience. Come on get your act together and do things properly. I am sorry to give a negative review of your handling of my order. The serum is however excellent and does all it promises.

Disclaimer: Everyone's skin type is different and different products work best for different people. I got niacinamide because initially I wanted to use a retinol serum but found out that AHA/BHA and retinol should /not/ go together, so I went for niacinamide instead and started using sunscreen with it as well. This may also be this product working in tandem with the sunscreen added to my skincare routine, but my skin cleared up really nicely! It took about 8 weeks for my face to clear up (which, honestly, is a pretty good time) and I'm really happy with the turnout. I have oily/acne prone skin from genetics, so if you have a similar skin type as me then it may work for you! Just be warned that the serum has a very slight oily/sticky(?) feeling while not being oily at all, but putting a good moisturizer after the serum helps with that sticky-ish feeling.

This might work for other people but it didn’t suit me well. I switched from Cetaphil to this and it caused my skin to peel in the first week. I didn’t realize this lotion caused it until I realized it was the only new thing in my routine.

I would recommend putting a dab on your wrist for a few days as a precaution before putting this on your face. I developed a severe allergic reaction to this moisturizer. I thought it was normal due to my research on what retinol can do to your skin when you first start using it..but it was not normal. It started out with hives..I have severe redness under my eyes, neck, and face. It also itches and is very flaky. I see a lot of positive reviews so I just wanted to let everyone know that this product is not designed to suit everyone.

I use this as a final coat on top of toner, serum and moisturizer. I find it to work well only in very small pores. It has a nice mattifying finish to reduce shine on the face and prevent an oily look.

I bought two products from CeraVe: cream and lotion. Both are packaged without any additional packaging or film - just bottles inside the mailing box. And there were traces of blood on the bottle of lotion - horrible! I didn’t notice it right away and I’m not sure if I touched it or not. I understand that this is not a problem with the CeraVe company or product. But I am leaving this review in hopes that CeraVe will force Amazon to investigate and find out why employees are working without gloves and with safety violations!

Little to no grit in the cream. Does not take much to get a lather and use so it will last you awhile. Has a calming sweet scent but not overpoweringly sweet.

I had the smaller starter size at first to make sure it didn’t irritate my skin. I ended up buying the full size because I saw a difference in my pores and skin texture after a few washes . I wash my face with a small amount everyday . I also use the texture tonic after and then the water cream which is so nice and cold when you first apply .A few months in, my skin feels and looks better along with monthly hydro facials at the spa . In my opinion it’s a nice skin care routine .

It is just a cleanser, there is nothing particularly special about this product. If you tend to use unscented products you will find the scent overwhelming, as I did.

I am 40 years old with fair skin. I have combination skin that's prone to rosacea and cystic acne. The good: it smells and feels good. It's more effective than the Cetaphil cleanser. The bad: I use a sulfur spot treatment and the cleanser couldn't wash away the spot treatment or the masks I've applied, even after 3 attempts. So, I don't think it's actually doing anything. I didn't notice any improvement in my skin, either, and I used the whole bottle. Not worth the money.	Others#0	Smell#1	General feel/effect#1	Results#2	Price/Value#-1

If you have NUT Allergies, PLEASE do not buy this lotion. It has Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil in it, and I had  a horrible reaction. If you do not have allergies, I will say this was a really nice feeling lotion (Before I had to take a trip to the Urgent Care). I gave the lotion to a friend who does NOT have allergies to nuts, and she loves it, so I will say that this is a very nice lotion for her. The container is nice, and I loved the pump. The scent was a tad odd to me since it had said it is a floral scent, I found it to me more chemically smelling, but it faded fast, and the lotion itself did feel very nice and not greasy.

I had such high hopes when I purchased the 5 step Resist skin care regimen. I was looking to minimize my pores, diminish fine lines, improve skin texture and hydrate.

This is the best primer I've ever used for minimizing pores. The formula goes on smoothly and fills in pores seamlessly. The slight hint of color seems to help camouflage other slight imperfections as well which helps to give my overall complexion a more even appearance. It works great under both liquid and powder foundations. I sometimes use it on 'no makeup' days, too, just to even out my skin tone. It only takes a small amount to do the job so a tube will last me for quite some time. I've been using this for years and have no plans to switch to any other primer.

I’m not crazy about the smell which I find mildly unpleasant but the results are excellent. After washing with this cleanser my face feels very clean and absorbs serum and lotion very well. Pores are clearer and skin feels really soft. I also like that the size is generous–you only need a tiny bit–the dispenser gives the perfect small amount. Excellent value for the money.

I have used this product for several years, it does not leave a greasy,sticky feeling. My primer does not pill when applied over the moisturizer. I’m assured of sunscreen with the spf it contains. The pump on the bottle can be problematic, it doesn’t always want to function on new bottles and leaves quite a bit of product in the bottle when 'empty', I use a q-tip to remove several more applications after the pump quits.

this last particular tube of primer came quickly but definitely was different from what I usually get. It’s usually thicker, almost a toothpaste like consistency,  and glides over the skin nicely making it feel almost like silk and creating a nice base for makeup. What was in this last tube was tinted liquid that was more like foundation than a primer. I don’t know if it’s the particular seller but dissatisfied and disappointed is an understatement.

I will admit I got influenced into buying this product. I don’t usually write reviews but I decided to write one today because I was so disappointed in this product. The face wash does not remove oil, makeup, or dirt as it claims. Considering you are paying quite a bit of money for a medical grade face cleanser, you would think it would do the job. Every time I used it I was disappointed and thought I would give it another chance. Every time I got out of the shower there was still makeup and oil on my face. Not sure what benefit this product truly has. Might be good for mature skin or highly sensitive skin. Would not recommend for oily/combination/acne prone skin. If you are looking for an ineffective expensive product with little to no cleansing properties this is the one for you!! Such a gimmick. Would give zero stars if I could.

There’s a lot of product & I like that it’s a glass bottle that is dark & comes with a dropper. I’ve used it everyday morning & night for two weeks. It has helped shrink my pores just a small amount. But not very much. It’s easy to use quick to absorb and there is no stickiness but as far as productive at shrinking pores I have to give it two stars. It seems efficient to a point. But I don’t think I will repurchase this brand niacinamide. The glow recipe niacinamide worked better for me.

I love this lightweight moisturizing serum. The consistency is thin and lotion-like, yet it creates a gorgeous nourishing cushion on the skin.  The formula is very elegant, absorbs beautifully and gives my skin a beautiful dewy glow.  It has both retinoids and niacinamide - two powerhouse anti-aging/brightening ingredients.  I've been using this nearly every day for almost a month and it's definitely improved my skin's appearance and elasticity.  I use a prescription grade retinoid (from Agency) three days a week and this has been the perfect complement to use on my nights off the stronger product.  There's no added fragrance and the clay-like scent is mild and relatively innocuous.  Pricey but worth it.
