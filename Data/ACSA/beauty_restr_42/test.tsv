Have very large pores. Have tried almost every product on the market claiming to hide or plur  Always met with disappointment and wasted money. Not this one. Patting it on works the best.

I have an autoimmune disease that causes dry skin and sensitivity. I shouldve read the description more closely. This is not for sensitive skin nor dry skin as it dries my skin even more. As you can see in my picture, it flakes and causes redness. Unfortunate because I love their other products. This one is just not meant for me.

Another drawback is how much packaging is wasted, this item is only 0.5oz and comes in an unnecessarily big box. The final drawback is the amount of product you get for the price, 0.5oz seems like a very small tube of product for how expensive it is.	Sustainability#-1	Packaging#-1	Quantity#-1	Price/Value#-1

This cleanser remains my favorite because it smells so fresh and leaves my skin so smooth. A very small amount does a great job. The gentle “grit” part of the lotion releases any buildup that appears on the skin, whatever the circumstances. The price just isn’t an issue. It isn’t expensive, and because small amounts are so effective, it lasts. The last bit is the same quality as the first. It’s a wonderful product.

I cannot be without this cleanser! I tried to break up with it because it is so expensive, but nothing does my skin so good as iS CLINICAL Cleansing Complex! I buy the smaller size and try to use as little as possible--a little goes a long way--to make it last longer. Also like using a cleansing balm prior, especially in the summer.

Like some of the 1-star reviews, mine came with the safety seal opened. As I started to use it, the scent reminded me of Dial soap. I tried to Google it, went down a rabbit hole, and found that dermatologists have recommended that people with acne-prone skin use Dial soap! Is this product just Dial soap? I've used the $25 itty-bitty bottle for the past few months and have not seen any significant changes. It would be funny if it were Dial soap. LOL! Jokes on me.

First, this product is expensive-  the tube is tiny.  Luckily I only use it on my nose, so I don't feel as ripped of as others who apply to their entire face.  The product works well to fill in pores.  It blends with my skin tone and becomes invisible.  But because it is meant to fill pores and not do the job of foundation, I need that too.  Only problem is, it is NOT compatible with foundation, whether you apply it under or over.  I have tried several different foundations and it is a muddy mess no matter how much or little or each product you use.  After all of my experimentation, I can confidently say that this aspect of the product is a huge fail.	Price/Value#-1	Quantity#-1	Results#1	Tone/Color#1	Others#-1	Skin/Hair Issue#1

Well, I have used this now religiously every night and every morning and for the life of me I just can’t see any difference to my face. It dries in very, very fast hardly giving me a chance to cover my face and forehead. And even though it dries in too fast it left my face very sticky for over an hour before I could put my moisture on. It may well work fantastic for others but I would have liked to have seen a difference to my skin.	Results#-1	Absorption#-1	Texture/Thickness#-1

I love tatcha products! I’ve used so many different face washes and had issues. Tatcha is easy on my skin, cleans my face and leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized.

I've used this product for years and loved it, but in my most recent order, I was sent a version of it that behaves entirely differently from what I've used in the past. Whatever changes they made to the product made the goop more liquidy than before, it did not minimize my pores, and it flaked off of my skin soon after applying. So sad I will have to find something new, but whatever their current formula is makes this product not actually do what it's intended to do.
