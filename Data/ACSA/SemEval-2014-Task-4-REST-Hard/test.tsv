while there's a decent menu, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza.	food#-1	service#-1
great food but the service was dreadful!	food#-1	service#-1
while it was large and a bit noisy, the drinks were fantastic, and the food was superb.	ambience#-1	food#-1
yes, they're a bit more expensive then typical, but then again, so is their food.	price#-1	food#-1
tiny restaurant with very fast service.	service#-1	ambience#-1
the food is so good and so popular that waiting can really be a nightmare.	food#-1	service#-1
the food was definitely good, but when all was said and done, i just couldn't justify it for the price (including 2 drinks, $100/person)...	food#-1	price#-1
but dinner here is never disappointing, even if the prices are a bit over the top.	food#-1	price#-1
cool atmosphere but such a let down.	ambience#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people.	service#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
a mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices.	ambience#-1	food#-1	price#-1
give it a try, menu is typical french but varied.	food#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
we ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came.	service#-1	food#-1
i have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistant.	service#-1	food#-1
the appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.	food#-1	service#-1
it's a basic pizza joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what i go for.	ambience#-1	food#-1
the service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game.	service#-1	food#-1	ambience#-1
i was on jury duty, rode my bike up centre street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and hibiscus lemonade.	food#-1	ambience#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine.	food#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
the new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: no, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone.	food#-1	price#-1
it' only open for lunch but the food is so good!	food#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
how can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices?!	food#-1	price#-1
the food was mediocre and the service was severely slow.	food#-1	service#-1
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices.	food#-1	price#-1
although the restaurant itself is nice, i prefer not to go for the food.	ambience#-1	food#-1
