to be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora.	food#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1

faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	service#-1
the price is reasonable although the service is poor.	service#-1	price#-1
pricey, but worth a try, at least once.	price#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
unfortunately, the food is outstanding, but everything else about this restaurant is the pits.	food#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
they are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.	service#-1	ambience#-1
overall a oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	service#-1
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.	food#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	service#-1
eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	ambience#-1
granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants.	service#-1	ambience#-1
the environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.	food#-1	service#-1	ambience#-1
if you're craving for haru's great food, especially the house roll, but can't stand the wait building outside, head across the street to their sake bar!	food#-1	service#-1
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	price#-1
they might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says i love you.	food#-1	service#-1
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	food#-1
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.	service#-1	ambience#-1
it costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.	food#-1	price#-1
the food is great, service is ok.	food#-1	service#-1
the rest of the dim sum, though pricey by chinatown standards, is worth it.	food#-1	price#-1
the ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.	service#-1	ambience#-1
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it.	food#-1	ambience#-1
while we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.	ambience#-1	food#-1
while the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in new york city, there is definitely better food in that range, and so sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	ambience#-1	price#-1	food#-1
prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.	food#-1	price#-1

i was a little leary about mary's at first - it's small, crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but i'm glad i finally tried it.	ambience#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1

we were fans of the half-price saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit.	food#-1	price#-1

the food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go.	food#-1	ambience#-1
even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.	food#-1	price#-1
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.	service#-1	food#-1
however, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.	service#-1	ambience#-1
outstanding bagels, but you get what you pay for.	food#-1	price#-1
the svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!	service#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1

it's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the pink pony can be so ruined by lousy service.	service#-1	ambience#-1
as much as i like the food there, i can't bring myself to go back.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	food#-1
nha trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegetables.	food#-1	service#-1	ambience#-1
if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in nyc.	food#-1	service#-1
the portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.	food#-1	service#-1
the service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.	food#-1	service#-1
the atmosphere isn't the greatest , but i suppose that's how they keep the prices down .	ambience#-1	price#-1
i would go again if i didn't have to pay.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	price#-1
delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.	food#-1	price#-1	ambience#-1
overall, i'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its chinatown.	price#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1
decent thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little nolita hangout, but service terrible.	food#-1	service#-1
sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.	price#-1	food#-1
so, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.	food#-1	ambience#-1

an excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing.	food#-1	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1

it's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.	food#-1	ambience#-1	price#-1
we actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.	food#-1	service#-1	price#-1

overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.	food#-1	price#-1
the menu is prix fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is well worth it superb food.	price#-1	food#-1
when we left at 8:00 pm, it was packed and noisy.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	ambience#-1
aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks.	food#-1	service#-1

the people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak english, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.	anecdotes/miscellaneous#-1	service#-1	food#-1
not the greatest sushi place, but excellent for a $19.95 all you can eat.	food#-1	price#-1
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.	food#-1	service#-1
other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!	food#-1	price#-1

thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.	food#-1	service#-1
