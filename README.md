# A Comprehensive Framework for Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis: Development, Annotation, and Evaluation

Hello and welcome!

This project aims to streamline the process of Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis. It features several key modules, including:

- Manual Annotation: An interface for detailed annotations.
- Semi-Automatic Annotation: Leverage our developed model for assistant annotations.
- Prediction Chart: Visualize sentiments for each category for a list of reviews using a sentiment index created after the prevision of the model.

  
Feel free to try the model trained on the new Beauty dataset (see the categories in the [Beauty annotation guidelines](https://github.com/lorisdiquilio/ACSA-Framework-using-T2T-model/blob/main/Annotations%20Guidelines_beauty.docx)) through our demo available on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lorisdq/PyACSA
