Now to be fair I know the serum bottle is what I bought and it was in1 piece, nevertheless it is unacceptable to have such apathy towards any part of the customer process and experience. Come on get your act together and do things properly. I am sorry to give a negative review of your handling of my order. The serum is however excellent and does all it promises.",

This may also be this product working in tandem with the sunscreen added to my skincare routine, but my skin cleared up really nicely! It took about 8 weeks for my face to clear up (which, honestly, is a pretty good time) and I'm really happy with the turnout. I have oily/acne prone skin from genetics, so if you have a similar skin type as me then it may work for you! Just be warned that the serum has a very slight oily/sticky(?) feeling while not being oily at all, but putting a good moisturizer after the serum helps with that sticky-ish feeling.",

Be sure to use SPF over top as retinol can make you more sensitive to sun burn.  Really happy with this one!",
